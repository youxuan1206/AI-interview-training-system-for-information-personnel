Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.\nRead in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.\nConvert these digits into an integer (i.e. \"123\" -> 123, \"0032\" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\nIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.\nReturn the integer as the final result.\n\nNote:\n\nOnly the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\nDo not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"42\"\nOutput: 42\nExplanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.\nStep 1: \"42\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"42\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n           ^\nThe parsed integer is 42.\nSince 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"   -42\"\nOutput: -42\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"   -42\" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)\n            ^\nStep 2: \"   -42\" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)\n             ^\nStep 3: \"   -42\" (\"42\" is read in)\n               ^\nThe parsed integer is -42.\nSince -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"4193 with words\"\nOutput: 4193\nExplanation:\nStep 1: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)\n         ^\nStep 2: \"4193 with words\" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')\n         ^\nStep 3: \"4193 with words\" (\"4193\" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)\n             ^\nThe parsed integer is 4193.\nSince 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n0 <= s.length <= 200\ns consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.\n\n",

This is 0 if there is no intersected node.\nlistA - The first linked list.\nlistB - The second linked list.\nskipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\nskipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.\n\nThe judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3\nOutput: Intersected at '8'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.\n- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1\nOutput: Intersected at '2'\nExplanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).\nFrom the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4].

From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes of listA is in the m.\nThe number of nodes of listB is in the n.\n1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104\n1 <= Node.val <= 105\n0 <= skipA < m\n0 <= skipB < n\nintersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect.\nintersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.\n\n \nFollow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?",

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Note that the '\\n' and '\\t' are the new-line and tab characters.\nEvery file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by '/'s.

        "content": "Given the root node of a binary tree, your task is to create a string representation of the tree following a specific set of formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n\nNode Representation: Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.\n\n\nParentheses for Children: If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses. Specifically:\n\nIf a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.\nIf a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.\n\n\n\nOmitting Empty Parentheses: Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., ()) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception: when a node has a right child but no left child. In such cases, you must include an empty pair of parentheses to indicate the absence of the left child. This ensures that the one-to-one mapping between the string representation and the original binary tree structure is maintained.\nIn summary, empty parentheses pairs should be omitted when a node has only a left child or no children. However, when a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: \"1(2(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Originally, it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be \"1(2(4))(3)\".\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,null,4]\nOutput: \"1(2()(4))(3)\"\nExplanation: Almost the same as the first example, except the () after 2 is necessary to indicate the absence of a left child for 2 and the presence of a right child.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n",

The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program.

This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\nIn C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n\nThe string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\nThe string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\nAfter removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = [\"/*Test program */\", \"int main()\", \"{ \", \"  // variable declaration \", \"int a, b, c;\", \"/* This is a test\", \"   multiline  \", \"   comment for \", \"   testing */\", \"a = b + c;\", \"}\"]\nOutput: [\"int main()\",\"{ \",\"  \",\"int a, b, c;\",\"a = b + c;\",\"}\"]\nExplanation: The line by line code is visualized as below:\n/*Test program */\nint main()\n{ \n  // variable declaration \nint a, b, c;\n/* This is a test\n   multiline  \n   comment for \n   testing */\na = b + c;\n}\nThe string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.\nThe line by line output code is visualized as below:\nint main()\n{ \n  \nint a, b, c;\na = b + c;\n}\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = [\"a/*comment\", \"line\", \"more_comment*/b\"]\nOutput: [\"ab\"]\nExplanation: The original source string is \"a/*comment\\nline\\nmore_comment*/b\", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length <= 100\n0 <= source[i].length <= 80\nsource[i] consists of printable ASCII characters.\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\nThere are no single-quote or double-quote in the input.\n\n",

The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]\nExplanation:\nn is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.\nThe output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:\noutput[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)\n- a is the id of a philosopher.\n- b specifies the fork: {1 : left, 2 : right}.\n- c specifies the operation: {1 : pick, 2 : put, 3 : eat}.\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 60\n\n",

You cannot change any number to 3 since 3 > limit.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,1,2], limit = 2\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: nums is already complementary.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == nums.length\n2 <= n <= 105\n1 <= nums[i] <= limit <= 105\nn is even.\n\n",

The orderTypei is:\n\n0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or\n1 if it is a batch of sell orders.\n\nNote that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order type.

The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:\n\nIf the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy order is added to the backlog.\nVice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price in the backlog.

There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.\n- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.\nFinally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30.

There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.\n- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.\n- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.\nFinally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5.

He can pick any.\n\nOn Alice's second turn, she has no more pieces that she can remove.\nThus, Bob wins, so return false.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= colors.length <= 105\ncolors consists of only the letters 'A' and 'B'\n\n",

You are given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates there is a message channel between servers ui and vi, and they can pass any number of messages to each other directly in one second. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array patience of length n.\nAll servers are connected, i.e., a message can be passed from one server to any other server(s) directly or indirectly through the message channels.\nThe server labeled 0 is the master server. The rest are data servers. Each data server needs to send its message to the master server for processing and wait for a reply. Messages move between servers optimally, so every message takes the least amount of time to arrive at the master server. The master server will process all newly arrived messages instantly and send a reply to the originating server via the reversed path the message had gone through.\nAt the beginning of second 0, each data server sends its message to be processed. Starting from second 1, at the beginning of every second, each data server will check if it has received a reply to the message it sent (including any newly arrived replies) from the master server:\n\nIf it has not, it will resend the message periodically.

You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.\nAt every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:\n\nthe price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,\nthe cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.\n\nThe game goes on as follows:\n\nInitially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.\nAt every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.\nFor every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:\n\t\nIf the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.\nIf Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each.

The game goes as follows:\n- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.\n  Alice's net income is now -2.\n- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. \n  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.\n  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.\n- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.\n  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.\n- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.\nNow, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.\nIt is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.\n\nExample 2:\n\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]\nOutput: -7280\nExplanation: \nAlice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.\nThus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only.
